## Guidelines for Specific Situations

### In Code Reviews
- ✅ Focus on the code, not the person
- ✅ Use kind, constructive language
- ✅ Acknowledge good work
- ✅ Provide suggestions, not orders
- ❌ Don't make it personal
- ❌ Don't make assumptions about experience level

**Example - Good feedback:**
```
"I think we could improve performance here by using a set instead of 
a list for lookups. This would reduce time complexity from O(n) to O(1). 
Would you be open to that change?"
```

**Example - Bad feedback:**
```
"This is inefficient code. Only beginners would write something like this."
```

### In Issues and Discussions
- ✅ Search for existing issues first
- ✅ Provide clear context
- ✅ Be respectful to maintainers
- ✅ Accept that decisions may differ from your preference
- ❌ Don't demand features
